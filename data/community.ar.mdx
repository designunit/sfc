# Our Community
We believe in the power of communities, collective intelligence and self-organization. And we value active communication and dialogue with like-minded people who help us learn from each other's experiences and practices. That is why we create communication platforms for all those who contribute to greening our cities.

In 2021, with the support of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the Green Cities program, the GREEN DATING [un]conference was held in St. Petersburg, where participants and experts from different cities of Russia, more often than not, said to each other, "Hi! I am subscribed to/follow you on Facebook!"

In 2022 We started to cooperate in a remote format that helps the community of Green Cities to stay in touch and support each other's initiatives.
