# Green Cities

Green Cities - an international program for exchange of experience and practices for sustainable urban development that is based on cooperation, care and responsibility.

We support all city residents who contribute to urban greening, we help find like-minded individuals and get acquainted with greening practices in other cities.

Our community grows with its members and gives everyone the opportunity to share knowledge, learn to act together so that our cities become greener and more sustainable.
